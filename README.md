# ðŸŒ¸ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) - Iris Dataset Classification (Task 6)

This repository contains my submission for **Task 6** of the **AI & ML Internship**, focused on implementing **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classification using the Iris dataset.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

To classify different types of Iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on sepal and petal measurements using the **KNN algorithm**.

---

## âœ… Steps Covered

1. Loaded the **Iris dataset** from `sklearn.datasets`
2. Split data into **train** and **test** sets
3. Standardized features using `StandardScaler`
4. Trained a **KNN Classifier** with `k=5`
5. Evaluated the model using:
   - Accuracy
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report
6. Tested multiple `k` values to find the best accuracy
7. Plotted:
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Accuracy vs K plot
   - Decision Boundary (optional)
